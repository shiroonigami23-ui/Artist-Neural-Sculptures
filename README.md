# Artist Algorithm Design: Neural Sculptures
This repository showcases a unique AI architecture developed through **Phase Resonance** and **Hebbian Pruning**, bypassing standard backpropagation.

## Evolution of a Thought
| Stage | Visualization | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0. Synchronization** | ![Visual for Stage 0](visuals/colony_sync_v1.png) | 10 oscillators finding a shared rhythm. |
| **1. Entropy** | ![Visual for Stage 1](visuals/colony_noise_v1.png) | Resilience to noise with increased coupling. |
| **2. Hebbian Learning** | ![Visual for Stage 2](visuals/hebbian_learning_v1.png) | Connections strengthen based on co-activity, adapting to external rhythms. |
| **3. Associative Memory** | ![Visual for Stage 3](visuals/associative_memory_v1.png) | The network learns and recalls multiple rhythmic patterns. |
| **4. Neural Canvas** | ![Visual for Stage 4](visuals/neural_canvas_v1.png) | Emergent 2D spatial patterns, showing collective 'thought'. |
| **5. Sculpting Memory** | ![Visual for Stage 5](visuals/neural_brush_v2.png) | Imprinting a 'brushstroke' pattern onto the neural canvas. |
| **6. Pruning Sculpture** | ![Visual for Stage 6](visuals/pruned_sculpture_v1.png) | Pruning away weak connections to reveal the 'sculpted' neural architecture, representing the learned memory. |
| **7. Temporal Prediction** | *(Visual Missing)* | Predicting the trajectory of a moving stimulus. |
| **8. Predictive Anticipation** | *(Visual Missing)* | A second layer 'anticipates' sensory input, generating predictions. |
| **9. Prediction Error** | *(Visual Missing)* | Detecting and responding to unexpected sensory events. |
| **10. Active Inference (Motor Tracking)** | *(Visual Missing)* | The AI actively moves its 'body' to track and minimize prediction error. |
| **11. Selective Attention** | *(Visual Missing)* | Focusing on one stimulus amidst competing inputs. |
| **12. Dopamine Reward** | *(Visual Missing)* | Learning through reward signals to reinforce successful behaviors. |
| **13. Metabolic Constraint** | *(Visual Missing)* | Simulating energy limitations and their impact on neural activity. |

## Installation & Usage
No special installation, just run the Colab notebook!

## License & Usage Warning
This repository contains experimental code for a research project. While the concepts are open-source and encouraged for study, the implementation is highly specific to the Colab environment and project structure. Direct copying and execution of this code without deep understanding and adaptation to your environment is strongly discouraged and will likely lead to errors. Please use as inspiration and educational material, not as a plug-and-play solution.
