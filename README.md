# Artist Algorithm Design: Neural Sculptures
This repository showcases a unique AI architecture developed through **Phase Resonance** and **Hebbian Pruning**, bypassing standard backpropagation.

## Evolution of a Thought
| Stage | Visualization | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0. Synchronization** | ![Visual for Stage 0](visuals/colony_sync_v1.png) | 10 oscillators finding a shared rhythm. |
| **1. Entropy** | ![Visual for Stage 1](visuals/colony_noise_v1.png) | Resilience to noise with increased coupling. |
| **2. Hebbian Learning** | ![Visual for Stage 2](visuals/hebbian_learning_v1.png) | Connections strengthen based on co-activity, adapting to external rhythms. |
| **3. Associative Memory** | ![Visual for Stage 3](visuals/associative_memory_v1.png) | The network learns and recalls multiple rhythmic patterns. |
| **4. Neural Canvas** | ![Visual for Stage 4](visuals/neural_canvas_v1.png) | Emergent 2D spatial patterns, showing collective 'thought'. |
| **5. Sculpting Memory** | ![Visual for Stage 5](visuals/neural_brush_v2.png) | Imprinting a 'brushstroke' pattern onto the neural canvas. |
| **6. Pruning Sculpture** | ![Visual for Stage 6](visuals/pruned_sculpture_v1.png) | Pruning away weak connections to reveal the 'sculpted' neural architecture, representing the learned memory. |
| **7. Temporal Prediction** | *(Visual Missing)* | Predicting the trajectory of a moving stimulus. |
| **8. Predictive Anticipation** | *(Visual Missing)* | A second layer 'anticipates' sensory input, generating predictions. |
| **9. Prediction Error** | *(Visual Missing)* | Detecting and responding to unexpected sensory events. |
| **10. Active Inference (Motor Tracking)** | *(Visual Missing)* | The AI actively moves its 'body' to track and minimize prediction error. |
| **11. Selective Attention** | *(Visual Missing)* | Focusing on one stimulus amidst competing inputs. |
| **12. Dopamine Reward** | *(Visual Missing)* | Learning through reward signals to reinforce successful behaviors. |
| **13. Metabolic Constraint** | *(Visual Missing)* | Simulating energy limitations and their impact on neural activity. |
